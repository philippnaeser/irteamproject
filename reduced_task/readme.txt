Here you can find other ranking methods and evaluations.

First, run putting_it_all_together to create train.csv and test.csv (train.csv is 500MB, so i did not include it in github)
To train and evaluate a ranklib model, simply open a shell here and run train_reduced first, then test reduced (for windows, you may want to copy the command to the powershell,
if sh is not enabled on your computer). Since this is a Java framework, make sure you have set JAVA_HOME in your PATH Environment Variable
